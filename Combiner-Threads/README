command to test this code:
for example:   
$ ./combiner 10 7 input.txt

Notice: 
1. here in the command line, 10 denotes the number of slots in every communication buffer 
and 7 denotes the number of users in the input.txt file. Please note that the second number(e.g. 7) 
equals to the number of users in your input.txt file. 

2. If you want to test a different number of users, 
like 5, please also delete the users in your input.txt file to make sure the number of users in the input 
file equals to the second number of command line, e.g.5!

3. To have a correct output, the third parameter(file name) must be the full name of file, including filename extension!
